title: About Me
---

Hi, I'm Mantej Singh, a Biomedical Engineering Phd Candidate at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. My interests are in the intersection of Medicine, Machines and Humanity. My research is in designing <a href="https://www.fridmanlab.org/neuroengineering" target="_blank">Brain Machine Interfaces</a> and <a href="https://durr.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Computational Biophotonics</a>. In my free time, I enjoy exploring coffeeshops, doing stand-up comedy, and rock climbing.

### Work Experiences

* <strong> Software Architecture Intern, Lutron, Austin TX May 2021 — Aug 2021
Developed an easy to use, versatile and reusable graph data structure in Swift that can be used to build troubleshooting guides to solve different technical issues faced by customers trying to set up their home systems.My framework allowed engineers to rapidly build and incorporate a troubleshooting guide within their apps which has led to a 30% decrease in customer calls to the technical support hotline, freeing up resources for more pertinent issues.

* <strong> Robotics Research Intern, Kavraki Lab, Houston TX Jan 2021 — May 2021
Designed a novel robotic motion planning algorithm, Parallel Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree, that utilized multi-threading to
calculate valid paths for autonomous robotic vehicles more quickly and efficiently.
The algorithm was able to calculate a valid motion path for an autonomous vehicle navigating obstacles 2.35x faster than the
traditional sequential version of the algorithm.

* <strong> Computational Neuroscience Intern, Tandon Lab, Houston TX May 2020 — Aug 2020
Built an automated system to reconstruct 3D vascular models of the brain from a patient’s MRI images to aid neurosurgeons in
planning safer and more effective surgeries. Software currently pending FDA approval for use in clinical settings.
Developed a brain-to-text machine learning system to classify brain neural data into speech to aid patients with speech/neurological disorders in communication. Achieved a 20% classification accuracy across 23 English phoneme classes that match industry-leading classification models.

* <strong> Software Developer Intern, Concur Hipmunk, San Francisco CA May 2019 — Aug 2019
Developed Andrepanel, an internal company tool to drive the parsing and visualization of important metrics such as popular flight
routes, hotel bookings placed through our mobile app, and website booking systems into an intuitive dashboard.
Pioneered an intuitive front-end glossary system that pairs with Andre panel to allow employees, regardless of technical expertise,to acquire data in a faster and
