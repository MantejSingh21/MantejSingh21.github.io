title: About Me
---

Hi, I'm Mantej Singh, a Biomedical Engineering Phd Candidate at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. My interests are in the intersection of Medicine, Machines and Humanity. My research is in designing <a href="https://www.fridmanlab.org/neuroengineering" target="_blank">Brain Machine Interfaces</a> and <a href="https://durr.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Computational Biophotonics</a>. In my free time, I enjoy exploring coffeeshops, doing stand-up comedy, and rock climbing.
